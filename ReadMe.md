### Getting Started

### WSL

### nvm

Discuss why we should stick to LTS for our code

### npm

Keep up to date, don't use earlier than v6

Benefits: npm audit runs automatically

npm init: discuss

### git

- Getting installed and creating ssh keys.
- Create a repo
- Add a ReadMe: why
- Add a git ignore: why
- Source: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore
- Good resource to bookmark: https://github.com/github/gitignore

### folder structure
- app
- lib
- tests

Discuss

### Test framework

npm install --save-dev jest : discuss syntax

Why jest? It is simple and works out of the box. It is highly configureable. What do our FE Engineers use?
